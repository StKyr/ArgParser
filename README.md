#ArgParser
Parse arguments in Python - A slightly modified version of the Python Standard Library :: argparse module.



This is basically the argparse.ArgumentParser class with one difference:

parse_args() method returns a dictionary of the arguments parsed.
Also, identical parseArgs() method created for naming preferences.

Other than that, use the argparse methods and classes.

Official documentation for the argparse module can be found here:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html
